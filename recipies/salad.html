    <h1>This salad probably isn't that healthy</h1>
    <p>Salad recipes are my favorite way to showcase vibrant, in-season produce – fruits and veggies that are so good on their own that you don’t need to do much to make them into a delicious meal. On cold winter nights, I like to brighten up our dinner table with a big, colorful mix of root veggies and hearty greens. On beautiful, warm days when I’d rather be outside than in the kitchen, summer salads are the perfect solution: they’re simple to toss together, but they’re totally delicious nonetheless.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound broccoli crowns </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons mayo, I like Sir Kensington's or vegan mayo </li>
        <li>1½ tablespoons apple cider vinegar </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Dijon mustard </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon maple syrup or honey </li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, minced </li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon sea salt, more to taste </li>
        <li>⅓ cup diced red onions </li>
        <li>⅓ cup dried cranberries</li>
        <li>½ cup almonds</li>
        <li>½ cup pepitas</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tamari</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon maple syrup</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon smoked paprika, more to taste</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Chop the broccoli florets into ½-inch pieces and any remaining stems into ¼-inch dice. Peel any woody or course parts from the stem first.</li>
        <li>In the bottom of a large bowl, whisk together the olive oil, mayo, apple cider vinegar, mustard, maple syrup, garlic, and salt. Add the broccoli, onions, and cranberries and toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Place the almonds and pepitas on the baking sheet, toss with the tamari, maple syrup, and smoked paprika and spread into a thin layer. Bake 10 to 14 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes (they’ll get crispier as they sit).</li>
        <li>Toss the almonds and pepitas into the salad, reserving a few to sprinkle on top. Season to taste and serve.</li>
    </ol>
